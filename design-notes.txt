FracFoucs Scrape Bot
Design Notes


controller app

	runs on ewn3?
	provides services to scrapers - greasemonkey scraper and headless (casperjs) scraper
	publishes status by county to a GME map - need 2 status maps:
		number of reports in each county
		time since last scrape for each county 

	services:

	foundStates		// scrapers submit list of states encountered
					// alert if a new state is found
	foundCounties	// scrapers submit list of counties found for a state
					// alert if a new county is found
	startScrapeTask	// Return a task that needs doing - an entire state, or just one county in a state
					// use a last completed timestamp to determine which one to do next
					// task is marked as in progress
					// update status of all in progress tasks, expire stale tasks, alert on expired tasks
	completeScrapeTask	// mark a scrape task completed 
	foundReports	// scraper submits a page of reports scraped from the results page
					// returns the list of reports which are not in the database
	parsePDF		// scraper sends a PDF which gets stored then parsed
					// parsed PDF is returned




HeadlessScraper
	uses casperjs , phantomjs
	runs as a cron - kill and restart every hour

	call getScrapeTask - get a scrape task. if no task available then exit
	send list to foundStates
	select state in form
	send list of foundCounties
	select county in form (optional)
	submit search form
	sort by job date
	for each result page
		scrape results, send to foundReports
		for all new reports, download PDF and send to parsePDF 
	call completeScrapeTask
	go back around for another task - the cron job will kill it


GreaseMonkey Scraper
	Runs inside the browser
	requires greasemonkey or tampermonkey
	on the search form:
		calls foundStates
		calls foundCounties
		adds a "Auto Parse" button which will 
			call startScrapeTask
			Perform the search
			scrape all the result pages
			call completeScrapeTask
	
	On any search result page:
		calls foundReports
		adds links to siteinfo on API numbers
		adds update button for each row that is not in the database
	On pdf update button click
		download PDF and send to parsePDF
